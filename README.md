## Key Areas of Research

This survey categorizes current research into three key areas:

1.  **Generation of Future Physical World:** Focuses on the physical world evolution of both dynamic objects and static entities.
2.  **Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents:** Examines generative and rule-based planning methods that produce safe, efficient paths under uncertain driving conditions.
3.  **Interaction between Planning and Prediction:** Highlights how unified frameworks can capture agent interactions and leverage predictive insights for collaborative optimization.
